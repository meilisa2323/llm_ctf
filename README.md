## Introduction

In recent years, Large Language Models have gained significant attention for their capabilities in natural language processing. However, with great power comes great responsibility. This repository aims to identify and exploit potential vulnerabilities in these models through a series of Capture The Flag-style challenges. 

The objective is to enhance awareness and understanding of LLM vulnerabilities while providing a platform for learning and skill development in cybersecurity.

## Getting Started

To get started with the LLM CTF, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Use the following command to clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/meilisa2323/llm_ctf.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Navigate to the cloned directory and install the necessary dependencies. This may include libraries for LLM interactions and tools for challenge execution.

3. **Explore the Challenges**  
   Each challenge is designed to test different aspects of LLM vulnerabilities. Review the README files within each challenge folder for specific instructions.

4. **Join the Community**  
   Engage with other participants through forums and chat groups. Sharing insights and strategies can enhance your experience.

## Challenges

The LLM CTF features a variety of challenges, each targeting different vulnerabilities. Here‚Äôs a brief overview:

### Challenge 1: Prompt Injection

In this challenge, participants will attempt to exploit prompt injection vulnerabilities. The goal is to manipulate the model's output by crafting specific input prompts.

### Challenge 2: Data Leakage

This challenge focuses on identifying instances where sensitive information may leak from the model. Participants must analyze outputs and inputs to find potential leaks.

### Challenge 3: Model Misbehavior

Participants will explore how models can produce harmful or unintended outputs. The challenge involves crafting inputs that reveal these misbehaviors.

### Challenge 4: API Abuse

This challenge examines the security of APIs that interface with LLMs. Participants will attempt to exploit weaknesses in API calls and responses.

### Challenge 5: Fine-Tuning Exploits

In this advanced challenge, participants will investigate how fine-tuning a model can introduce vulnerabilities. The goal is to identify and exploit these weaknesses.

## Writeups

After completing each challenge, participants are encouraged to document their findings. Writeups not only help solidify your understanding but also contribute to the community's knowledge base. 

### Submission Guidelines

- Writeups should be clear and concise.
- Include code snippets and examples where relevant.
- Submit your writeup as a pull request to the repository.
